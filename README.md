**A Desktop application for managing Library computer sessions**

I created a Desktop Library management system that aids in managing student sessions. The users gets a time limit to use the computer.
The system is tailored in a way that it only accepts institutional emails. 
the system sends a verification code to the user email and if correct the user is logged in the computer for a given time. 
Security is accounted for and user cannot able to close the application. To make sure of this the application runs as a start-up application.
